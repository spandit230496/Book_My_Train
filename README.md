## Book Seats Algorithm Explained

- One person can reserve up to 7 seats at a time.
- If person is reserving seats, the priority will be to book them in one row.
- If seats are not available in one row then the booking should be done in such a way that the nearby
  seats are booked.
- User can book as many tickets as she/he wants until the coach is full.
- Different stages of Algorithm
  - Stage-1: Book Seats in row if available then return
  - Stage-2: Book Seats in such a way that nearby seats are booked then return, using `Graph Based Algorithm`.
  - Stage-3: If not found seats in row or any connected group of seats.
  - Stage-4: Then try to book maximum number of seats nearby if possible then return.
